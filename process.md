##Process

#####Will the team meet in person or not? If so, how often and for how long?
The team will meet in person twice. Both times will take around one hour. 

#####Will the team meet virtually? If so, how? What will the meetings look like?
It is not necessary for the teams to meet virtually. However, the teams might 
need to clarify things while implementing the project. This could be quick 
emails or text messages. Also, team members will send frequent updates.

#####What will be the format of any in-person or virtual meetings?
In-person meetings will be informal. The first time, the team should discuss 
the design of the project and decide the workload of each team member. The 
second time, the team should wrap up the project and submit the project.

#####Will the team use other tools like Slack or GroupMe?
The team can use email or text messages. These tools are easiest for everybody.

#####How will progress on the project be tracked?
Progress will be tracked via frequent updates via email or text messages. The 
team should also frequently commit to github.

#####How will the work be broken down into units and assigned to team members?
Work will be broken down evenly. Team members will decide what they are able to
do and what they prefer to do. This will happen during the first meeting.

#####What will be the structure of the Git repo? What are the rules for branching and committing?
The git repository will contain a master. Everybody should develop on their own 
branch. Before merging to master, the team member should pull from master and 
check for errors. The most important rule is not to push any breaking code to 
master. Additionally, team members should commit frequently.

#####What is the standard for testing? Do you require code coverage metrics, if so, what?
Testing should be meaningful. It should be thorough if possible. However, 
there is no reason to rewrite code to make it testable. Therefore, it is not 
required.

#####How should the team handle team members that aren't pulling their weight or are struggling?
The team should attempt to help other team members. However, they should not do
their work for them. It is unfair for the other team members. 

#####How should the team handle non-responsive team members?
The team should discuss it with Professor White.

#####What documentation must be provided?
All complex functions must be commented. It will help other team members.
Github commits must be thoughtful and descriptive. Additionally, bugs must 
be properly described on github.

#####How will the team track bugs?
The team should inform other team members of bugs via email or text message.
However, the bug should be described thoroughly on a github issue. The 
description should provide a way to reproduce the bug, the problem it is 
causing, and an idea about where the bug is coming from. The team member 
will then fix the bug and close the issue.

#####What are expectations on interaction with you (the customer) to make sure that the team builds the right thing?
Asking questions before attempting to build the project is a good thing. It 
ensures that the team is not wasting their time building an incorrect product.
The team may contact me via email.

#####What are the coding standards?
All complex functions must be commented. It will help other team members.
There should be proper encapsulation. There should not be a lot repeating 
code. Additionally, there should not be huge complex functions.

#####How should the team handle change requests to you (particularly for scope)?
The team may email me about change requests. Improvements or simplifications 
may be necessary.

#####How will adherence to the process be measured?
Proper code commenting and thoughtful git messages are the most important part
of the process. Therefore, a review of the code and git messages will determine
the adherence to the process.
